The *qrs-mime* tool is a command line tool based on node.js. It allows you to add mime-type definitions to Qlik Sense server.

This tool can be used to add the missing mime types in Qlik Sense 2.1.1 to make typical visualization extensions work again, but in general, this tool can also be used to add support for very specific Mime-types in your Qlik Sense environment.
