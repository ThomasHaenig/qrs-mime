Some recommendations if *qrs-mime* does not work:

* Make sure that you can reach the server, use ping `<servername>` to see if you can ping it
* Ensure that no firewall is preventing communication over port 4242 (certificates) or 80/443.
* Running the tool can take a minute or two, please be patient and wait for the result.
