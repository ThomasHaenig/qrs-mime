## Installation

Make sure that you have node.js installed, otherwise install node.js

Use [npm](https://npmjs.com) to install _qrs-sense_ globally.

```bash
npm install qrs-mime -g
```

## Usage

After installation of _qrs-mime_ using [npm](https://npmjs.com) open the [node.js](https://nodejs.org) command line and run _qrs-mime_ using one of the following options:

* **Run the tool directly on Qlik Sense server**

* **Run the tool on a different machine**

If this is the case, you need to set up proper authentication between your machine and the server where the Qlik Sense Repository Services (QRS) is running on.

### Running qrs-mime directly on Qlik Sense server

(TBD & tested)

### Running qrs-mime on a different machine / using header authentication

If you have properly set up header authentication for QRS, you should then have the following information to run qrs-mime:

* Fully qualified name or IP-address of your server (e.g. `myserver.mydomain.com`)
* Name of the virtual proxy (e.g. `hdr`)
* Whether to use SSL or not
* The user you want to map to:
  - The header key and (e.g. `hdr-usr`)
  - The header value (e.g. `mydomain.com\myUserName`)
* The user define in your header-value should have rootAdmin permissions on QRS

Then run the following command:

```bash
qrs-mime 
    --auth=header 
    --server=myserver.mydomian.com 
    --virtualproxy=hdr 
    --ssl 
    --header-key=hdr-usr 
    --header-value=mydomain.com\myUserName
```

_(Remove line breaks which were just added to improve readability)_

**Note:**

* Depending on the connection to the server, it can take a minute or two until the the job is done.
* Further options can be defined if necessary.

### Running _qrs-mime_ on a different machine / using certificates

[![](docs/images/qrs-mime-result.png)](#installation)

If you have exported the certificates and copied to your system, you should then have the following information available to run `qrs-mime`:

* Fully qualified name or IP-address of your server (e.g. `myserver.mydomain.com`)
* Name of the virtual proxy (if needed, leave blank if you are unsure)
* Whether to use ssl (define it, if you are unsure)
* Location of the certificate file (e.g. `C:\CertStore\client.pem`)
* Location of the key file (e.g. `C:\CertStore\client_key.pem`)
* Location of the ca file (e.g. `C:\CertStore\root.pem`)
* The user you want to map to (if not defined the below values will be used)
  - The header key and (e.g. `X-Qlik-User`)
  - The header value (e.g. `UserDirectory=Internal;UserId=sa_repository`)

```bash
qrs-mime
    --auth=certificates
    --server=myserver.mydomain.com
    --ssl
    --cert="C:\CertStore\client.pem"
    --key="C:\CertStore\client_key.pem"
    --ca="C:\CertStore\root.pem
```

**Note:**

* Depending on the connection to the server, it can take a minute or two until the the job is done.
* Further options can be defined if necessary.

Some references helping to set up certificate based authentication:

* [Qlik Sense Developer Help: Exporting certificates](http://help.qlik.com/sense/2.1/en-US/online/Subsystems/ManagementConsole/Content/export-certificates.htm) (ensure to use the platform independent format)
* [Qlik Sense Developer Help: Connecting using certificates](http://help.qlik.com/sense/2.1/en-us/developer/Subsystems/RepositoryServiceAPI/Content/RepositoryServiceAPI/RepositoryServiceAPI-Example-Connect-cURL-Certificates.htm)

## Command line options

* **`--help`** (alias `-h`) - Display the usage guide.
* **`--debug`** (alias `-d`) - Return debug info.
* **`--server`** - Server where the QRS is running.
* **`--virtualproxy`** - Name of the virtual proxy.
* **`--auth`** (alias `-d`)
Authentication method, can be either "certificates" (c) or "header" (h).
Defaults to "certificates".
* **`--port`** (alias `-p`) Port to be used.
If you want to use the default port, use 0 or leave blank.
In case of using certificates leave either blank or use 4242.
* **`--ssl`** - Whether to use SSL (defaults to false). If `--ssl` is not set, SSL is not used.
If SSL is desired, define --ssl, otherwise omit this option.
* **`--header-key`** - Header key, typically used when using header authentication, in case of using certificates it defaults `X-Qlik-User`
* **`--header-value`** - Header value, typically used when using header authentication, in case of using certificates, it defaults to `UserDirectory=Internal;UserId=sa_repository`
* **`--cert`** - Path to the certificate file, typically `client.pem`
* **`--key`** - Path to the key file, typically `client_key.pem`
* **`--ca`** - Path to the ca file, typically `root.pem`
* **`--passphrase`** - (TBD, not clear if needed at all)
* **`--file`** - Path to the file containing the definition of mime-types, by default the file you can find in this repository under `./config/mime-types.txt` will be taken.

## Troubleshooting

Some recommendations if _qrs-mime_ does not work:
* Make sure that you can reach the server, use ping `<servername>` to see if you can ping it
* Ensure that no firewall is preventing communication over port 4242 (certificates) or 80/443.
* Running the tool can take a minute or two, please be patient and wait for the result.

## Known Issues

* None, so far
